By examining these positions in more detail, you can investigate whether your mystery genome is heterozygous at these positions or if their might be a sequencing error or other factor impacting the distribution of reads you observed\n",

Provide a possible explanation for the pattern that you observe. How do you think this pattern might differ for the other mystery genomes that your classmates are analyzing? \n",
    "3) Describe a scenario in which it might be useful to visualize the sequences that align to a position of interest using `samtools tview`. \n",
    "4) When viewing the aligned reads using `samtools tview`, the total number of sequences that you see might be greater than the numbers output by the samtools mpileup and bcftools mpileup commands that you ran. What is a possible explaination for this descrepancy?\n"
